Classifier to detect actionable findings in radiology reports
===============
The R script can be used to build classifiers to detect actionable findings in radiology reports. Various feature sets can be constructed using different preprocessing steps (stemming, removal of stopwords, negations, and previously known or stable findings) and n-grams. The random forest model that performed best on a training set of Dutch radiology reports (data not provided because of privacy reasons) is given, together with the vocabulary to generate the document-term matrix.
